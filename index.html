            <h2 class="section">“BOND, JAMES BOND.”</h2>
            James Bond (007) is a British Secret Service agent created in
            1953 by Ian Fleming. Over the years, there have been more than
            20 movies with different famous actors portraying the British
            agent. As a fan of the series, I want to work with this dataset to
            deliver an analysis of how 007 movies have changed over time.
            <br>
            <h3 id="description-of-james-bond-dataset">DESCRIPTION</h3>

            <p>I am going to work on the “James Bond Movie Dataset” from <a
                    href="https://www.kaggle.com/dreb87/jamesbond">Kaggle</a>.
                This dataset includes information about 24 James Bond
                movies from 1962 to 2015. Using the data, I want to explore these ideas:
                <br>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Correlation between Martinis and how often Bond kills someone?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Which Bond actor has highest average rating?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>How have budget and revenues of the movies changed?</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Where are the locations depicted in the movies?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Difference in movie length for each Bond actor</p>
                </li>

            </ol>
        </div>
        <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>


        <div>
            <h4>1. Martinis vs. Kills</h4>
            <div id="q1">
                James Bond (007) is often portrayed as a heavy drinker with the iconic "shaken, not stirred" martinis.
                He's also an expert marksman. In this analysis, I want to see if there is a correlation between the
                number of martinis he drinks and the number of people he kills.

            </div>
            <!-- <h4>Plot:</h4> -->
            <div id="q1_plot" class="center_plot">
            </div>
            <div id="q1_answer" class="center_plot" style="text-align: left;">
                The plot show the average number of martinis Bond drinks and the average number of people he
                kills per movie. Based on the plot, there is no direct correlation between the number of martinis
                Bond drinks and the number of people he kills. A lot of the red dots are clustered at zero and one
                drink.
                This could be due to the fact that Bond is not always drinking while on a mission.
                It's safe to say Bond's killings seem to be independent of his drinking
                habit, as there is no pattern that connects the two.

            <h3>2. Highest rated Bond actor</h3>
            <div id="q2">
                Using the data from IMDB and Rotton Tomatoes, I want to see which Bond actor has the highest average
                rating from each of their movies. I want to look at each Website's rating separately and then compare
                the two ratings.

            </div>
            <div>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"> Average rating for each Bond actor</p>
                <div id="radio" class="center_plot">
                    <input type="radio" id="q2_imdb" name="rating" value="imdb" checked="checked">
                    <label for="Avg_User_IMDB">IMDB</label>
                    <input type="radio" id="q2_tom" name="rating" value="tomato">
                    <label for="Avg_User_Rtn_Tom">Rotten Tomatoes</label>

                </div>
                <div id="q1_plot" class="center_plot">
                </div>
            </div>
            <div id="q2_plot" class="center_plot">
            </div><br>
            <div id="q2_answer" class="center_plot" style="text-align: left;">
                There is a slight difference between the ratings from the two websites. IMBD's ratings have smaller
                range than Rotten Tomatoes. On the higher end, both websites rate Sean Connery and Daniel Craig highest
                at around 7.2 average.
                The lowest rated Bond from IMDB is Pierce Brosnan at 6.47 while Roger Moore is the least favorite from
                Rotten Tomatoes at 5.68. The difference could be due to the fact that Rotten Tomatoes is more
                critical than IMDB. Keep in mind, this rating does not reflect each actor's performance in the movie.
                There are many other factors that go into the rating such as the plot, the director, the cinematography,
                etc.

        <div>
            <h3>3. Budget and Revenue:</h3>
            <div id="q3">
                As a popular franchise, the James Bond movies have a large budget. I want to see how the budget and
                revenue of the movies have changed over the years. I want to see if there is a correlation between the
                budget and the revenue of the movies. The data is adjusted to 2013 dollars.

            </div>

            <div id="q3_plot" class="center_plot">
            </div>
            <!-- <h4>Result</h4> -->
            <div id="q3_answer" class="center_plot" style="text-align: left; ">
                Budget seems to steadily increase over the years while revenue seems to be more volatile.In the period
                from 1981 to 1989, the franchise did not have a lot of success. This seems to reflect the ratings from
                Rotten Tomatoes above as Bond was portrayed by their lowest rated, Roger Moore. Keep in mind the
                revenues of the
                movies do not solely depends on the actor. The movies could also
                have been
                poorly written or poorly directed. The movie could have also been poorly marketed. More data is needed
                to answer the question why some movies do better than others financially.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>4. Locations</h3>
            <div id="q4">
                As a secret agent with a mission to save the world, Bond has been to many exotic destinations,
                from snowy mountains in Switzerland to deserts in Chile.
                Using the Shooting location provided in the dataset,
                I calculated the frequency each country appears in the series.
                I then plotted a choropleth map to visualize where Bond has been.
            </div>
            <div id="q4_plot" class="center_plot">
            </div><br>
            <div id="q4_answer" class="center_plot" style="text-align: left;">
                Looking at the distribution on the map, England is on top of the list with 24 appearances in all 24
                movies. No surprise there since this is where Bond calls home. US, Russia and Italy are among the top
                locations chosen for Bond movies. Switzerland and Spain also appear in a few movies. It'll be
                interesting to see where Bond's next mission will take him. </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>5. Movie Length</h3>
            <div id="q5">
                The length of a movie depends on several factors, including the genre, the complexity of the plot, and
                the director's vision for the film. In this analysis, I want to see how the length of the James Bond
                movies has changed over the years. I want to see if there is a correlation between the length of the
                movies and the year they were released. I also want to see if there is a difference in the length of the
                movies for each Bond actor.
            </div>
            <div id="q5_plot" class="center_plot">
            </div><br>
            <div id="q5_answer" class="center_plot" style="text-align: left;">
                The plot shows the average length of the movies for each Bond actor. An average length of a typical
                feature film
                is around 90 minutes. All 007 movies are much longer than that. In the early days of the franchise
                (with Sean Connery), the movies were shorter with a median at 115 minutes. The movies have been getting
                longer over the years. The median length of the last movies with Danial Craig is now around 140 minutes.
                Keep in mind even though the data is grouped by each Bond actor, the disparity in the length of the
                movies largely depends on the director's vision and the budget for the film.
                <br><br>
                An interesting observation is that, the movies with Sean Connery and Daniel Craigs are rated highest,
                yet they are on opposite ends of the length spectrum. This suggests that the length of a movie does
                not correlate to its quality.
